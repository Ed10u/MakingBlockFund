## 🚩 Challenge 4: Voting

🎫 Deploy a Voting contract to learn the basics of voting inside of a DAO on the Flow blockchain and Cadence. You'll use:
- The local Flow emulator to deploy smart contracts. 
- The local Flow dev wallet to log into test accounts.
- A template Next.js app with sample scripts and transactions to interact with your contract.

🌟 The final deliverable is a DApp that spins up an open DAO that lets community members create proposals and vote within it based on token holdings that govern the DAO.
